# Plant-Wheat-Detection-Using-Ai
This project analyzes the detection and the growth stages of wheat crop by capturing a digital image of the crop from time to time by a Raspberry pi Camera Module V2. This image is then transferred to a computer for analysis. The analysis is done by the deep learning algorithm Convolutional neural network CNNs
